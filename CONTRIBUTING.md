# Contributing Guide

Follow this guide to contribute to schol development.

## Creating new templates

The recommended way to begin creating a new schol template is to clone the [schol-template-default repository](https://github.com/schol-js/schol-template-default). Detailed instructions are available on that repo's readme.

There's also [a video demonstrating how to create new templates on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JWafzK6h4c).

## Developing schol

To get started developing schol, you'll need Git 2.19+, Node 8.12+, a text editor, and a terminal.

Get started by cloning the schol repo and installing its dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:schol-js/schol.git
cd schol
npm install
```

You can then open the project files in your text editor and hack away. Run `npm test` to run the test suite.

If you want to test your local version of schol from the command line, run `npm link` from within the schol directory. This will link your global `schol` command to your local version of schol.

You may also wish to make changes to [generator-schol](https://github.com/schol-js/generator-schol) -- this is the dependency schol uses to initialize new projects.
